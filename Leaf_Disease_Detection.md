# üåø Leaf Disease Detection Web App

A Flask-based web application that uses a deep learning model to detect plant leaf diseases from images and suggests appropriate treatments. Built with Python, PyTorch, and ResNet-18, the app is optimized for cloud deployment (Heroku/AWS) and features a responsive frontend with a clean dark-green theme.

## üå± Introduction

Plant leaf diseases are a major threat to global food security. This application provides early detection and diagnosis using machine learning. Users can upload an image of a leaf and receive real-time predictions with treatment recommendations.

## üéØ Objective

To develop a user-friendly web app that:
- Classifies leaf diseases from uploaded images using a trained CNN.
- Provides actionable treatment suggestions.
- Is ready for deployment on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Python** ‚Äì Core language  
- **PyTorch** ‚Äì For building and training the model  
- **ResNet-18** ‚Äì Transfer learning for image classification  
- **Flask** ‚Äì Web framework for backend  
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** ‚Äì For frontend UI  
- **Heroku / AWS** ‚Äì Deployment platforms  

## üîç Methodology

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Used an augmented dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images.
- Each class was organized in separate folders for easy labeling.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Resized all images to 224x224 pixels.
- Normalized using ImageNet statistics.
- Split into 80/20 training and testing sets.

### 3. Model Training
- Utilized ResNet-18 with pretrained weights.
- Final layers retrained using CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer.
- Metrics monitored to avoid overfitting.

### 4. Flask Integration
- Backend handles image upload, prediction, and treatment lookup.
- Frontend styled with a dark-green themed UI for ease and relevance.

### 5. Deployment Preparation
- Configured `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and `runtime.txt` for Heroku/AWS.

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Accurate disease classification with confidence scores  
- ‚úÖ Real-time treatment recommendations  
- ‚úÖ Upload and predict directly via web interface  
- ‚úÖ Clean and responsive dark-green UI
